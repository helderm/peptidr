Met with team to discuss the work. Talked about features - Helder mentioned hashing could be useful. We would all reasearch more. There was also some talk about HMMs.

I stated reading about related works in this area. The notable work was *Improved prediction of signal peptides* by Bendtsen etal. This is the paper behind the SignalP service which is very popular. They use HMM and NN. They also trim the sequecnces to 60 AAs. This was very usefull since our classifers did not work well of very long sequences.
I then creasted a shared latex document for the team.

I also read some of the other works that were cited by the Signal P paper. I summerised the these works in the related work section and introduction of the report.

I was then working on visualizing signal peptides using weblogo as recomended. I decided to take one sequence file from the positve examples and compare it with one of the negatives. The results where as follows:
![signal peptides](./plots/logo_p.png)
![signal peptides2](./plots/logo_neg.png)
It is clear that the A and L proteins affected the signal peptides. I also removed the first amino acid as it made visualisation difficult it was too heavily loaded in all files.

wrote the the findings in the report including the weblogo difference in sequences.

Wrote the abstract and edited grammatical and language errors in the report.
